1.npm add axios  (api from  https://dictionaryapi.dev/)
2.import axios from axios 
3.add apiUrl inside the search function
4.then add  axios.get(apiUrl).then(handleResponse);
5.create handleResponse function it will receive a response  and console.log npm
6.bugs such as TypeError: Cannot read property 'prototype' of undefined React Express
soltuion:Delete this code import response from { 'express' }
7.open console log and axios will always have response inside "data" array (1)
8.replace the world hello with whatever word ($keyword) the user type/  let apiUrl = `https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en_US/${keyword}`;
backtick v.i since it's a variable 
9.(response.data[0]);  to display the first item in the array of data .
Another lesson
1.we are using state to send whatever we get back from api , send info to component results (response.data[0])
store the definition of the word which typed by user and  update whenever the user change the word their searching for differnet word
   2.   <Results results={results}/> result no1 = componentname  results2= property  results3= propertyvalue
